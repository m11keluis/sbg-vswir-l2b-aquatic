## 2 Introduction

Following on recommendations by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine in their 2017 Decadal Survey on Earth Sciences, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission for implementation as part of its Earth System Observatory (ESO).  SBG in particular aims to measure properties of the Earth’s surface composition and ecology.  It is comprised of two platforms: a wide-swath thermal infrared instrument on a free-flying spacecraft in a polar orbit with an afternoon equatorial crossing time; and a separate spacecraft carrying a wide-swath solar reflectance imaging spectrometer operating in the Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR), with a morning equatorial crossing time.  SBG-VSWIR will measure the solar reflected range at approximately 380-2500 nm at 10 nm spectral sampling, over a 180 km swath with 30 m spatial sampling.  This measurement enables repeat coverage of any location on Earth every 16 days.  The visible-shortwave infrared range is sensitive to diverse physical processes in the Earth’s surface and atmosphere (Cawse-Nicholson 2021). The spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolutions of the SBG VSWIR instrument will enable Earth-system-scale measurements of aquatic ecosystems, including biogeochemistry products across inland, nearshore coastal, and open ocean ecosystems.  

Thus, this algorithm theoretical basis document describes the algorithm process used to derive chlorophyll and inherent optical properties within the L2+ Aquatic Biogeochemistry and Composition section of the SBG-VSWIR aquatic workflow (Figure 1).
